Here are some great ideas for new FOSTIVE tools that we haven't had time to implement!

We'd love you help either:

* Adding more ideas to the list
* Implementing one of the ideas

In either case, [create a Pull Request](https://github.com/fostive/unimplemented-ideas/pulls) in this repo that either adds an idea to the list or puts your name next to an idea you want to implement.
